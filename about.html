                    Alana is a third-year undergrad student at the Tufts University College of Engineering where she is pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Dance. She has taken various coding courses and has worked with C, C++, JavaScript, Java, Python, HTML, and SQL. She is a strong leader in her community as the current co-director of Tufts Tap Ensemble, e-board member of the Society of Women Engineers, and e-board member for the Women in Technology conference at Tufts University which had over 400 participants. Working 1-on-1 with students as a course assistant for CS15 Data Structures has taught her how to effectively communicate programming ideas to others and how to understand the ideas communicated to her. This position accelerated her proficiency in locating bugs in complex code and finding a solution.
