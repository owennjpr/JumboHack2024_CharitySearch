# Non-Profit Search for Jumbohack 2024 
https://owennjpr.github.io/JumboHack2024_CharitySearch/about.html
## The Project
The goal of our project was to create a simple way for people to effectively connect with and discover charities and non-profits. Our website allows users to filter through charities by cause so that they can hopefully narrow down further on the specific issues they are passionate about. 

## The Team
This project was created by Alana Sendlakowski, Owen Prendergast, and Chris Holden. Alana worked primarily on the backend and API connectivity of our website. Owen worked mostly on the frontend, style, and layout, and Chris contributed to both the front and backend.

## Acknowledgements
This project uses the every.org charity api to populate our search results.
